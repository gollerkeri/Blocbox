## Checkpoint 36

####Website feedback
+ Clean, helpful home page, including useful information like cost of service, how it works, etc.
+ Dashboard was intuitive, easy to understand how one would use it to create new items
+ A number of users identified the similarity to Dropbox, unprompted. So the basic product funtionality was well understood

~ Most people expected more clickable links than actually provided! This led to some user confusion:
  + Website looked like a real, functioning service but didn't have additional screens beyond dashboard
  + Probably need more clickable screens/pages to gather additional user feedback
  + Some users weren't sure whether the purpose was to save their own notes, lists or save content/articles or save images. A more narrowly focused MVP might help focus on the specific pain point being solved (e.g., the best multi-device note taking app)
  
  
####Building Blocbox
The most enjoyable aspect of the experience was seeing the project come to life--beginning with the early mockups in Balsamiq all the way to the deployed website. 
The most challenging aspect was getting to grips with CSS, which was an entirely new topic. In the early stages of building the website, I was just about coping with the checkpoints, and I wasn't able to expand beyond the required steps for most of the later checkpoints, because of my own technical limitations in CSS.
It was a nice bonus to learn some rudimentary Git and understand how to push code from your machine to github.
I wouldn't change very much either in the content or the way I approached it, I think the learning curve towards the end of the foundation course was steeper, but in an enjoyably challenging way.


Building Blocbox has piqued my interest in adjacent topics, e.g., Javascript and specifically, D3.js, which is a browser-based interactive data visualization toolkit. I'm also more interested in learning about the principles of responsive design, something we touched on a little in the course of building Blocbox. So overall, it's served as the starting point to identify additional topics I want to learn about.
